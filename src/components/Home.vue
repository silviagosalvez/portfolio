                        Silvia Gos치lvez Comuni칩n is currently in her fifth year of her Dual Degree in Law and International Relations 
                        at IE University in Madrid, her hometown. Most recently, she spent a semester abroad studying at 
                        Northeastern University in Boston. During that time she held a position as an art law intern at 
                        the Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts department in the Arts and Business Council of Greater Boston. 
                        Here she provided pro bono legal advice to artists and creators.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Alongside this, she has collaborated with two NGOs, Meraki Smile School in Madagascar and Fundaci칩n 
                        Educaci칩n para el Empleo. As part of her legal training, she has held two internship contracts, in 
                        the IP/IT department at ECIJA and in the multidisciplinary law firm Delyser Abogados.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Her passion for art, heritage conservation, and multiculturalism has led her to orient her 
                        professional development to the legal management of arts and cultural heritage.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Spanish being her mother tongue, she is also fluent in English and proficient in French. Further 
                        she is conversational in both Portuguese and Arabic.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Involved in her university's campus life, she has been President of the IE Photography Club and 
                        is a board member of the Innovation and Inclusion committee at IE Law School. Here she was able to 
                        successfully organize the event "Breaking Barriers" on LGBTQ+ inclusion in the education and labour 
                        sector. Academically, she is a member of the "Honors Program", a program composed of the top 5% of 
                        students with the best academic records at the university. She has also participated in IE's Legal 
                        Clinic, this last year acting as a project coordinator and teaching assistant.
                        <br/><br/>
                        An interesting fact about her is that her interpersonal communication skills allowed her to spend a
                        summer working as a tour guide in Porto, Portugal, a city she had never been to before.
